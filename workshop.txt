[h3]3.4 compatible. Might work on other versions too, but the launcher will complain.[/h3]

You were not able to select the special trait for cryogenic species with the frozen Planetary Diversity worlds, so this patch fixes that.

Feedback is welcome for other edge-case interactions to fix.

Overwrites one species traits file, which includes the other traits, but there's no other way to do it with stellaris code. Notify me for updates to Cryogenesis traits.
